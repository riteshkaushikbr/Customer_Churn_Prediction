## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn can significantly affect a company's revenue and growth. This project aims to build a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning using their demographics, usage behavior, and subscription data.

By leveraging various machine learning techniques, we enable businesses to:
- 📉 Reduce churn rates  
- 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️ Identify high-risk customers  
- 🎯 Design personalized retention strategies
